# SMAT files from David Gleich

[David Gleich][gleich] (Purdue CS) first introduced me to the idea of
studying spectral densities for graphs a couple years ago -- I reciprocated
by pointing out the idea of expanding the density.  David's [talk][spectre]
on spectral densities shows several example computations done on the
supercomputers at Sandia; these can be approximated more efficiently using
the methods here.  David was kind enough to share both the graphs and the
computed eigenvalues, and I have used this data in several of my own talks.
Pending permission to re-share, this directory is a stub for his data files.
